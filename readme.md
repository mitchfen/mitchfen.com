# Mitch Fenner's personal website

## About

A tiny site with links to my accounts and my pgp key.

## CI and deployment

- Dependabot updates the dependencies, and GitHub actions automatically merges pull requests when all checks pass.
- The site is published as a container to DockerHub and the GitHub container registry, but currently hosted as a static site on Azure.
